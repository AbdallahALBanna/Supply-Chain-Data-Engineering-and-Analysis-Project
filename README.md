## Introduction

### Dataset Overview
This dataset contains key supply chain components such as:
- **Sales:** Sales transaction records including product pricing, discounts, and order details.
- **Transactions:** Financial details like earnings and profit per order.
- **Customer Interactions:** Data on customer profiles, segmentation, and geographical locations.
- **Shipping Logistics:** Real vs. scheduled delivery times, shipping methods, and statuses.
- **Product Management:** Product IDs, names, descriptions, pricing, and availability.

### Project Goals:
- **Personalize interactions:** Use customer data to tailor marketing efforts.
- **Evaluate product performance:** Guide inventory and development decisions.
- **Increase revenue:** Refine pricing, promotions, and sales strategies.
- **Optimize shipping:** Improve accuracy and reduce delays in deliveries.

---

## Database Design

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** Visual representation of data organized into entities such as orders, products, customers, and categories.
- **Mapping & Data Transfer:** Data is mapped and transferred from Excel files into SQL using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services).

---

## ETL Process

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Python scripts are used for data extraction and cleaning.
- **Data Sources:** Multiple sources including Excel and SQL databases.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleaning, filtering, and aggregating to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
- **Incremental Loading:** Only new or updated records are loaded to optimize performance.

---

## Data Warehouse Design

- **Star Schema Design:** Includes **fact tables** (e.g., sales, profits) and **dimension tables** (e.g., products, time, shipping).
- **Optimization for Analysis:** Denormalized tables help in faster query performance and better analytics in OLAP systems.

## Machine Learning & Prediction

### Models Used:
1. **Logistic Regression:** Predicts shipment mode based on customer and order details.
2. **Random Forest Regression:** Predicts profits based on sales-related features.

### Model Evaluation:
- **Logistic Regression:** Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Random Forest Regression:** Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

## Data Analysis & Visualization

### Key Insights:
- **Business Performance:** Analyzing financial health through key metrics like net sales and profit.
- **Customer Insights:** Understanding customer behavior for better strategic decisions.
- **Product Performance:** Evaluating product trends and performance.
- **Inventory Management:** Assessing current practices and suggesting improvements.

### Power BI Dashboards:
- Business Performance Dashboard
- Inventory Management Dashboard
- Shipment Management Dashboard
